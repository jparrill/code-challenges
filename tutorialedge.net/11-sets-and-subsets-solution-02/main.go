/*
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, you are tasked with trying to implement a function that checks to see if a set is a sub-set of another set.

Weâ€™ll be carrying on the flying theme where the function takes in aÂ `slice`Â of Flights and then checks to see if they exist within anotherÂ `slice`Â of flights.

MORE EFFICIENT SOLUTION THAN SOLUTION 1
