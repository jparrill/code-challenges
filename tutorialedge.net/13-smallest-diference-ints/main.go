/*
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, you are tasked with finding the smallest difference between two slices of int values.

Example: Letâ€™s say I have 2 int arrays; [1, 2] and [4, 5]. The function should return the smallest difference which would be the difference between 2 and 4.

WARNING: The Page solution is not functional at all so this is my solution, is much computational complex, but works in all cases
